# Secure Design Review phase:

**1. Reviewing High-Level Diagram and Tech Stack**

The secure design review involves evaluating the high-level diagram and tech stack to ensure they meet the security requirements defined in the project.

* **Security Requirements**: Define the security standards, protocols, and best practices that must be implemented to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
* **Risk Catalogue and Mitigation Strategies**: Review the risk catalogue and mitigation strategies developed during the Risk Assessment phase to identify potential security risks.

**2. Secure Pipelines**
Identify potential risks in the CI/CD pipelines. (Example: CI/CD top 10)
Create security rules to prevent unauthorized code push, application builds or deployments.

**Consumes:**

* Risk Catalogue and Mitigation Strategies:
* High-Level/Platform Design:

**Produces:**

* **Secure Platform Implementation Guidelines**: Documented guidelines that outline the specific security measures, protocols, and best practices required for a secure implementation of the platform.
* **Updated Risk Register**: Updated risk register that reflects the security risks identified during this phase, along with mitigation strategies and potential consequences.
