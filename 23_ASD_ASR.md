# Attack Surface Detection and Reduction

**1. Finding Publicly Exposed Assets**

Find out the publicly exposed assets to determine the complete attack surface.

* **IaC**: Infrastructure as Code (IAIC) is used to identify publicly exposed assets, such as AWS S3 buckets or Azure Blob Storage.
* **Configurations**: Configuration files and settings are examined to identify sensitive data and access points.
* **OSINT**: Open-source intelligence gathering techniques are applied to gather information about publicly available data and potential vulnerabilities.


**2. Reducing the Attack Surface**

Reduce the attack surface by removing unnecessary exposure of assets.

* **Asset Prioritization**: Assets are prioritized based on their sensitivity and potential impact.
* **Exposure Reduction**: Exposures are reduced or eliminated to minimize the attack surface.
* **Configuration Changes**: Configurations are updated to remove unnecessary exposure.


**Consumes:**

* **IaC**: Infrastructure as Code (IAC) is used to identify publicly exposed assets.
* **Configurations**: Configuration files and settings are examined to identify sensitive data and access points.
* **OSINT**: Open-source intelligence gathering techniques are applied to gather information about publicly available data and potential vulnerabilities.
* **Application Data Catalogue**:

**Produces:**

* **Attack Surface Map**: A comprehensive map of the attack surface, including all publicly exposed assets and their corresponding risks.
* **Exposure Reduction Plan**: A plan outlining the steps to reduce the attack surface by eliminating unnecessary exposure.
