# Development

**1. Platform Development**

Create a secure and reliable platform for development, deployment, and operation of applications.

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Create IaC templates using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to manage infrastructure configurations.
* **Configurations**: Define and configure environment variables, database connections, and other critical settings.
* **Custom AMIs**: Create custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for specific environments, such as development, staging, or production.
* **Containers**: Use containerization tools like Docker to package applications and ensure consistent deployment across environments.
* **Security Tools Integration**: Integrate security tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewalls, and encryption technologies to protect the platform.


**2. CI/CD**

Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment of applications.

* **CI Pipelines**: Use tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD to automate testing, code analysis, and other checks.
* **CD Pipelines**: Integrate automated deployment scripts using tools like Ansible or Puppet to deploy applications to production environments.



**Consumes:**

* Risk Register
* Platform Design/High-Level Design
* Secure Platform Implementation Guidelines

**Produces:**

* **Secure Platform**: A secure and reliable platform for development, deployment, and operation of applications.
