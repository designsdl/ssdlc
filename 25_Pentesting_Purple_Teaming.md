Let's dive into the Pentesting and Purple Teaming phase.

**1. Perform Penetration Testing on Applications and Infrastructure**

Perform penetration testing (pentesting) to identify vulnerabilities in applications and infrastructure.

* **Application Deployment**: The application is deployed for pentesting.
* **Pentesting Tools**: Specialized tools are used to simulate attacks on the application and infrastructure.

**Example:**

| Pentesting Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Metasploit | Simulates attacks on the web application to identify vulnerabilities. |

**2. Perform Purple Teaming to Improve Detection**

Perform purple teaming to improve detection for infra and application level attacks.

* **Purple Team**: A team consisting of a red team (attackers) and a blue team (defenders) that simulates real-world attacks.
* **Detection Coverage**: The effectiveness of the security controls in detecting potential threats is evaluated.

**Example:**

| Detection Coverage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 90% coverage rate | Indicates that 90% of potential threats are detected by the security controls. |

**Consumes:**

* **Application Deployment**: The application is deployed for pentesting and purple teaming.
* **Organisation**: The organisation provides resources and support for the pentesting and purple teaming activities.
* **Application Data Catalogue**

**Produces:**

* **Pentest Reports**: A comprehensive report detailing the findings of the pentesting, including identified vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation.
* **Detection Coverage**: An evaluation of the effectiveness of the security controls in detecting potential threats.
* **Fine-Tuned Rules**: New rules are created to improve detection coverage.
* **New Rules**: New rules are added to the existing rule set to address newly discovered vulnerabilities.

By performing pentesting and purple teaming, we can identify vulnerabilities in applications and infrastructure and fine-tune our security controls to improve detection coverage.
