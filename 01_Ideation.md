# Ideation/Requirements Engineering Phase:

**1. Defining the goal of the application/service/feature**

The goal is a specific, measurable objective that the project aims to achieve. It's a clear statement of what the project wants to accomplish.


**2. Defining different types of requirements**

There are several types of requirements that need to be considered during the ideation phase:

* **Functional Requirements**: Define how the system will behave and what it will do.
Example: "The platform should have a login feature that allows users to access their personal settings."
* **Non-Functional Requirements**: Define the performance, scalability, usability, security, and other qualities of the system.
Example: "The platform should respond to user inputs within 2 seconds, and have a minimum uptime of 99.5%."
* **Domain Requirements**: Define the business rules, processes, and constraints that govern the application's domain.


**3. Defining priorities**

Priorities are used to determine which requirements are most important to meet initially. This helps focus on the most critical features first.
