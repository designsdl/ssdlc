## 1. Introduction  
The purpose of this RFC is to propose a specification for API diagrams to design and define microservices or web services. These diagrams provide a standardized structure to document the components and flow of API interactions, including endpoints, inputs, dependencies, functions, external calls, and returned data.  

---

## 2. Specification Details  

### 2.1 Structure  

The API diagram shall consist of the following fields in sequential order:  

1. **Endpoint**  
   - Represents the specific API endpoint (e.g., `/user/create`, `/order/status`).  
   - Indicates HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  

2. **Input Data**  
   - Defines the data structure sent to the API.  
   - Includes the format (e.g., JSON, XML) and example data (optional).  

3. **Dependencies**  
   - Lists all dependencies required for the API to function:  
     - **Authentication/Authorization** (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).  
     - **Input Validation** (e.g., schema validation).  

4. **Functions Called**  
   - Specifies the internal functions or services that the API invokes to perform its operations.  
   - Includes brief descriptions of these functions.  

5. **External Calls**  
   - Describes calls made outside the service, categorized as:  
     - **Local Services**: Services within the same application module.  
     - **Internal Services**: Services within the organization.  
     - **External Services**: Third-party APIs or external systems.  

6. **Returned Data**  
   - Details the structure and format of the data returned by the API.  
   - Includes response codes (e.g., 200, 404, 500) and example responses.  

---

## 3. Guidelines for Use  
- Use a visual representation for the flow between fields (e.g., flowcharts or sequence diagrams).  
- Ensure consistent labeling and clear descriptions for each component.  
- Include examples or templates to enhance clarity.  
- Use industry standards for documentation (e.g., OpenAPI or Swagger) where applicable.

## 4. Example Diagram  

### Endpoint: `/user/create`  
1. **Input Data**:  
   ```json  
   {  
       "username": "exampleUser",  
       "email": "user@example.com",  
       "password": "securePassword"  
   }
