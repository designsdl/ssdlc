# Design Phase:

**1. High-Level/Platform Design**

The platform design phase involves defining the overall structure and architecture of the application or system.

**a. Selecting High-Level Architecture Type**

The high-level architecture type determines the overall organization and structure of the system.

Example:
* **Monolithic Architecture**: A single, self-contained unit that encompasses all components.
* **Microservices Architecture**: A collection of loosely coupled services that communicate with each other.
* **Event-Driven Architecture**: A design pattern that focuses on event-driven interactions between components.

**b. Selecting Tech Stack**

The tech stack defines the technologies and frameworks used to build the application or system.

* **Hosting and Deployment Services**: Different cloud services, on-prem technologies

**c. CI/CD Pipelines**
Define and design the CI/CD pipelines to ensure smoother development and deployment experience for developers.

**d. Creating High-Level Component Design**

The high-level component design defines the individual components of the application or system.

Example:
* **Kubernetes Cluster**: To deploy microservices
* **Message Queueing Services**: For any event driven service

**Consumes:**

* Requirements:
* Risk Catalogue and Mitigation:
* Tech Stack Selection:

**Produces:**

* Component Diagram:
	+ Visual representation of the individual components and their interactions.
	+ Helps designers and developers understand the overall system architecture.
* Tech Stack:
	+ Defined selection of technologies and frameworks that meet the project's requirements.
