# Threat Modeling

**1. Identifying Potential Threats**

Identify potential threats to the systems and applications, including:

* **External Threats**: External attackers targeting the system or application (e.g., phishing, ransomware).
* **Internal Threats**: Malicious insiders with authorized access to sensitive data or systems.
* **Configuration Threats**: Configuration errors or misconfigurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.


**2. Identifying Security Issues**

Identify potential security issues that may arise due to errors in code, configuration, or other factors.

* **Code-Related Security Issues**: Vulnerabilities in the codebase, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
* **Configuration-Related Security Issues**: Misconfigurations of system settings, firewalls, or access controls.
* **Data-Related Security Issues**: Insufficient data encryption, storage, or backup procedures.


**Consumes:**

* Low-Level/App Design
* Threat Intel

**Produces:**

* **Threat Model with Threats and Mitigations**: A technical-level threat model that identifies potential threats, their likelihood, and mitigation strategies.
